# protobuf-ios

This repository contains carthage packages of Google Protocol Buffers library for iOS that is used as a dependency for Adform Tracking SDK.

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/objectivec).

This library is distributed as a static framework, therefore you should not add it to input/output files in Carthage copy-frameworks Build Phase.
